# Juniors Spring Intensive Deliverable Proposal

## TODO: copy this file, fill it out, and push it up to your project's repo.

Dates 3/16-3/25

**My Name: Luke Harrison | Thom d'Olanie**

**Project Name: the Drip**

**Is your project New or Old?: Old**

**Is your project Solo or Team?: Team**

## Description

**Basest level of the porject was built in SPD 1.3. It is a private site, inspired by the Dollars from DRRR. Users receeive an invite, join a group, and become part of a color gang. The goal is to attempt to out do other teams. Users can post and deed requests or brag. or do whatever. It's like bad social media.**

## Challenges I Anticipate

**[Multiple model edits - Will review several model structures and will only make changes if they will signifcant;y improve performance][refactoring design - need to review best practices for front end, industry design standards, and create better wireframes before making drastic changes to the site’s appearance][Blindspots/weaknesses - Both team members are DS track and most of the project fixes are in regards to the front end, will seek advice and help as needed][api implementation - read docs thoroughly, finish skateboard changes first, and have that live, add api’s to separate branch and only merge when 100% sure it will not break the previous version of site]**

## Skateboard

**ONE SINGLE aspect of product. Consider: build backend for SPD 1.2 front end, CRUD one resource, use API or library, authentication etc.**

**[Filters and design overhaul]**

## Bike

**ONE additional features that get you closer to your idealized product. Examples: CRUD 2nd resource, add comments, API use, authentication, library use**

**[Google maps api integrated, image image uploader for posts, refactor post , group, and user model]**

## Car

**ONE additional feature**
**[Individual messaging/chat for users]**
